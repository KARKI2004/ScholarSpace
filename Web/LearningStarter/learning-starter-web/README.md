# ScholarSpace

ScholarSpace is a full-stack academic platform for discussions and resource sharing, developed as part of a team-based university course project.  
The application provides blogs, discussion threads, user profiles, and role-based access, built with a .NET backend and a React (Vite) frontend.

## Project Context

This project was originally developed in a collaborative class repository with multiple contributors and iterative experimentation.

This repository contains a cleaned version of the project created for individual presentation and long-term maintainability. The original team repository remains unchanged.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Improve code readability and structure
- Remove noisy or redundant comments
- Present a clear and professional codebase
- Preserve academic integrity by keeping team history separate

## Technology Stack

- Backend: ASP.NET Core
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- UI: Mantine
- Authentication: Custom role-based system
- Database: Entity Framework Core

## Notes

This repository reflects the same functionality as the original team project, with no changes to core logic or behavior. Cleanup efforts were limited to formatting, structure, and documentation.
